Startups Club's Demo Day 2015-2016 App.

The app is almost complete.  
Unable to deliver the app since neither the team members were interested in the app nor were the customers interested in 
using an app like this despite requesting for it.  
The app could've been used properly. The code is all written properly with scalability in mind.

Now this app is just used as projects for college subjects.
